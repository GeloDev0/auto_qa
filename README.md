# 🧠 AutoQA  
**AI-Powered Test Case Generator**  
*Developed during Internship at **Aretex Philippine Outsourcing Inc.***

---

## 📖 About the Project  
**AutoQA** is a web application created during our internship at **Aretex Philippine Outsourcing Inc.**  
It uses **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** to help generate **test cases from user stories**.  
Instead of writing test cases manually, users can type their user stories, and the system automatically creates sample test cases to make the QA process faster and easier.  

The goal of this project is to help software teams **save time**, **reduce manual work**, and **maintain consistency** in testing.

## 🎯 Features  
✨ **AI-Generated Test Cases** – Generate test cases instantly from user stories.  
🖥️ **Simple and Clean UI** – Easy-to-use interface for both beginners and QA teams.  
📋 **Editable and Exportable Results** – Review, modify, and export AI-generated test cases.  
🔐 **User Authentication** – Secure sign-in and user sessions using Clerk.  
📱 **Responsive Design** – Optimized layout for both desktop and mobile users.  
⚙️ **Real-Time Integration** – Uses webhooks for seamless data communication.

## ⚙️ How It Works  
1. 🧾 **User inputs** a user story (example: *“As a customer, I want to log in securely so I can access my account.”*)  
2. 🤖 The **AI model (Gemini 1.5 Flash)** analyzes the story and generates related test cases.  
3. 🧩 **User reviews or edits** the generated results.  
4. 💾 **Save or export** the test cases for QA documentation.  

---

## 🧠 AI & Prompt Engineering  
The system uses **prompt engineering** techniques with **Gemini 1.5 Flash** to interpret user stories and generate high-quality, structured test cases.  
Prompts are optimized to understand intent, conditions, and expected outcomes based on the story context.
